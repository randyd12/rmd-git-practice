<h3>Get repository set up</h3>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>From github create repository</li>
    <li>From webstorm VCS-> Checkout from version control-> GIT </li>
    <li>add file '.gitignore'</li>
    <li>add file README.md</li>
    <li>Commit to local repository</li>
    <li>push to remote branch</li>
</ul>


<h3>Play with various types of features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>make a change and a commit</li>
    <li>add a blame on GITHUB - shows a commend on the code for the checkin</li>
    <li>edit file on github </li>
    <li>from github make a new branch</li>
    <li> try the webstorm - update instead of pull - does it fetch too so I have the new branch?</li>
    <li>that worked really well.  It did a fetch although I don't know if it did a pull and merge since I didn't make changes in this branch - making this change in the new branch in webstorm</li>
    <li>That time I make a change in master in WS, from github did a PR and merge+delete branch.  From WS I did an update.  It did everything: fetch, pull, merge.  The only thing it didn't do was delete my local branch that was deleted on the remote.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Make a label</h3>
<h4>so now I have a version I wasn to keep, for minor changes as it is a release.  Think RSA demo</h4>
<ul>
    <li>push all changes into master branch</li>
    <li>On github I created a release with the label "v0.01"</li>
    <li>From web storm I want to continue to make changes, one of them should get merged into RSA release, the other not</li>
    <li>also make a change that is only in the RSA release</li>
    <li>Per above:  This change should be in master branch and RSA release</li>
    <li>to make a change to the RSA release that doesn't affect trhe main branch...lets see if I can split the release into its own maintainable branch</li>
</ul>
