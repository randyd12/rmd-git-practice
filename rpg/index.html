<h3>Get repository set up</h3>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>From github create repository</li>
    <li>From webstorm VCS-> Checkout from version control-> GIT </li>
    <li>add file '.gitignore'</li>
    <li>add file README.md</li>
    <li>Commit to local repository</li>
    <li>push to remote branch</li>
</ul>


<h3>Play with various types of features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>make a change and a commit</li>
    <li>add a blame on GITHUB - shows a commend on the code for the checkin</li>
    <li>edit file on github </li>
    <li>from github make a new branch</li>
    <li> try the webstorm - update instead of pull - does it fetch too so I have the new branch?</li>
    <li>that worked really well.  It did a fetch although I don't know if it did a pull and merge since I didn't make changes in this branch - making this change in the new branch in webstorm</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
